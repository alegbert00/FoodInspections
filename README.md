# Chicago Food Inspections Project
Cleaning and analyzing a data set with information on health inspections for Chicago food establishments using R. 

This was a project I completed for health inspections at Chicago food establishments.  The goal was to clean and analyze using R-Studio, a platform I was fairly new to at the time. I worked with two others, but I was in charge of the coding aspect.  I wrote up two seperate project, one to clean and organize the data, the other to visualize and analyze it. My team members helped me take these findings and communicate them in a presentation. I learned a lot from this project and it helped me gain confidence in working with R.
